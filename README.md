# JavaExercises

Started learning coding in Java since 24th November 2016 following "Programming Methodology" lecture series of Stanford University delivered by Professor Mehran Sahami.
This repository (creation date 05 December 2016 at A-423, Aryabhatta Hostel, IIT BHU Varanasi, India) contains all my work in Java.
The book followed is "The Art & Science of Java".

The class was resumed on 24th January 2017 (Left studying the course due to unavoidable reasons). Revised all the concepts again and went through the course book thoroughly again.
